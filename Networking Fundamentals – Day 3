# 🌐 Networking Fundamentals – Day 3

This repository documents my daily progress in **Networking Fundamentals** as part of my **Cybersecurity learning journey**.

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 📊 Bandwidth
Bandwidth is the **capacity of a communication medium** to carry data.

- It represents the **maximum amount of data** that can be transmitted over a network connection.

---

### 🚀 Throughput
Throughput is the **actual rate of data transfer** over a network during a given period of time.

- It measures how many bits successfully travel across the network
- Affected by:
  - Network congestion
  - Hardware limitations
  - Latency and errors

---

### 🌐 Internet Speed (Download & Upload)
Internet speed determines how fast data is:
- **Downloaded** from the internet
- **Uploaded** to the internet

Speed affects:
- Browsing
- Streaming
- File transfers
- Online communication

---

## 🖥️ Clients and Servers

### Server
A **server** is a computer that runs software designed to provide services to other computers.

Examples:
- Email server
- Web server
- File server

---

### Client
A **client** is a device that requests services from a server.

Examples:
- Laptop
- Smartphone
- Desktop computer

---

### Hosts
Any device connected to a network that participates in communication is called a **host**.

---

## 🔁 Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking

### Advantages of P2P
- Easy to set up
- Less complex
- Low cost
- Useful for simple tasks

### Disadvantages of P2P
- No centralized administration
- Less secure
- Not scalable
- Devices act as both client and server

📌 In P2P networks, each device can function as **both a client and a server**.

## 🎯 Why This Matters
Understanding bandwidth, throughput, client-server models, and P2P networking is essential for:
- Networking fundamentals
- Cybersecurity
- SOC analysis
- Ethical hacking

Strong networking knowledge builds strong security skills 🔐
